# NASM TCP Client

This x86-64 assembly language TCP Client was completed as a final project for a Computer Architecture course. In pure assembly, we manage the socket connection to the server, request data, receive data, and then sort that data using selection sort. This code demonstrates the value of controlling execution flow and handling exceptions that may arise at the lowest level, as well as the implementation of conditional branches to organize a collection of data.
